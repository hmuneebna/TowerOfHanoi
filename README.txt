Task #2


In this program, the user will be asked to input the amount of discs to be used for stacking. The program will then display all the discs  being moved and stacked from each rod. The user is only allowed to input a number greater than 0, so each disc can be stacked and moved from rod to rod. The program will attempt to stack each disc on a different rod, but will not stack a larger disc on top of a smaller disc.
